# FnLPDEs_FBSNNs
A extension to fully nonlinear PDEs of the original FBSNN (Forward-Backward SDEs and Neural Networks) framework (by M. Raissi)

./FBSNNs - minimally modification (by Chubatov Andrey) for original Raissi's framework 
        (running on TensorFlow2 (TF2)) 
        
./FBSNNs_tf1_torch - modification (by Chubatov Andrey) for original Raissi's framework 
        (running on TensorFlow2 (TF2) + pyTorch)
