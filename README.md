# FnLPDEs_FBSNNs
A extension to fully nonlinear PDEs of the original FBSNN (Forward-Backward SDEs and Neural Networks) framework (by M. Raissi)

./FBSNNs - minimally modification (by Chubatov A.) for original Raissi's framework 
        (running on TensorFlow2 (TF2)) 
        
./FBSNNs_tf1_torch - modification (by Chubatov A.) for Shine's framework 
        (running on TensorFlow2 (TF2) + pyTorch) 

./FBSNNs_tf1_FnL_1D - original framework for  
        -- Fully non Linear Parabolic Equation (x in R^D) 
        -- system ((1+D) equations) of quasi linear PDEs
